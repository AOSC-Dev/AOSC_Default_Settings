AOSC_Default_Settings
=====================

Default Settings in Overrides, for AOSC OS

KDE4
=====================
KDE4 is slightly customized, nothing skel related. Some configurations are derived from Kubuntu, thanks!

1. Minor customization on the default panel;
2. No more freakin' "Do You Know...";
3. SSD optimization;
4. GTK+ pre-setting (Oxygen GTK+);
5. About Distro pre-setting (so it wouldn't segfault);
