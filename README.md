AOSC_Default_Settings
=====================

Default Settings in Overrides, for AOSC OS

Xfce
=====================
Xfce has some major appearance and functionality customization (just kidding...), including:

1. Default theme to Numix;
2. Whisker Menu instead of the default one;
3. Light Locker instead of XScreensaver;
4. Polkit GNOME as default agent for PolicyKit;
5. Changed panel preferences;
6. Added a splash screen;
